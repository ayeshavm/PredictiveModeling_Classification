    "# Predictive Modeling Project:  Petfinder.my Adoption Prediction (Kaggle)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters every day around the world. If homes can be found for them, many precious lives can be saved — and more happy families created.\n",
    "\n",
    "PetFinder.my has been Malaysia’s leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal adoption rates are strongly correlated to the metadata associated with their online profiles, such as descriptive text and photo characteristics. As one example, PetFinder is currently experimenting with a simple AI tool called the Cuteness Meter, which ranks how cute a pet is based on qualities present in their photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition you will be developing algorithms to predict the adoptability of pets - specifically, how quickly is a pet adopted? If successful, they will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world __on improving their pet profiles' appeal, reducing animal suffering and euthanization__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The objective is to predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the pet’s listing on PetFinder. Sometimes a profile represents a group of pets. In this case, the speed of adoption is determined by the speed at which all of the pets are adopted. The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdoptionSpeed\n",
    "\n",
    "Contestants are required to predict this value. The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way: \n",
    "<br>0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. \n",
    "<br>1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. \n",
    "<br>2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. \n",
    "<br>3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed. \n",
    "<br>4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions for Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) What feature/s influence the Adoption Speed of the pet?\n",
    "\n",

First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that Oi,j corresponds to the number of adoption records that have a rating of i (actual) and received a predicted rating j.

This is something that Petfinder.my can look into to ensure that these Health indicators are checked and updated, to be populated with either a Yes or No, instead of an 'Unsure' value.<br>\n",

A higher sentiment value means a more positive sentiment.  Surprisingly, this shows a positive correlation with the Adoption Speed, which means higher sentiment takes longer for Adoption.  It would be hard to tell with the data provided how the description affects the AdoptionSpeed, for us to be able to recommend how to improve it.
